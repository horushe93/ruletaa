## Open Source Components

This repository contains the core random selection algorithm of Ruletaa, shared for educational purposes:

### 🎲 Random Selection Algorithm

Our open-sourced random selection algorithm demonstrates how Ruletaa ensures fair and unbiased results:

1. **High-Entropy Randomization**: Implements cryptographically secure random number generation
2. **Weighted Selection Logic**: Accurately handles options with different weights
3. **Spin Physics Simulation**: Creates realistic wheel spinning behavior while maintaining true randomness

The algorithm is designed to be:
- Tamper-proof and manipulation-resistant
- Computationally efficient for smooth animations
- Statistically verified for true randomness

> Note: This algorithm is open-sourced for transparency and educational purposes. If you use it in your project, please credit Ruletaa as the source.


## FAQ

### Is Ruletaa truly random and fair?

Yes! Ruletaa uses a high-security random algorithm that guarantees fair results. Each spin is based on the weight of the options, and the outcome cannot be influenced externally, ensuring 100% fairness.

### How is my privacy protected?

* Your wheels are stored locally on your device
* No login required and no personal data is collected
* Your wheels are not uploaded to any server unless you choose to share them
* Only explicitly shared wheels are stored on the server for access facilitation
